Project Overview for GitHub:
------------------------------

**Description:**
The Node.js Job Portal is a web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It serves as a platform for users to register, log in, and manage job listings. The application includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for job listings, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete job postings. Additionally, the API endpoints are thoroughly documented using Swagger, providing developers with clear documentation and a user-friendly interface to interact with the API.

**Key Features:**
1. User Authentication with JWT Tokens: Secure your API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful registration, a unique JWT token is generated for each user. This token must be included in the headers of subsequent API requests to access protected routes, ensuring secure access to user-specific data.

2. Job Listing Management: Authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on job listings, including creating new job postings, viewing existing job listings, updating job details, and deleting job postings.

3. Express Backend: The application is built on the Express.js framework, providing a robust and scalable backend for handling HTTP requests and responses.

4. MongoDB Database: The project uses MongoDB as the NoSQL database to store and manage job listings and user data, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

5. Swagger API Documentation: The API endpoints are documented using Swagger, offering a comprehensive API reference with interactive documentation through Swagger UI.

6. Rate Limiting: The application implements rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` middleware, preventing abuse and ensuring the API's stability and security.



**API Endpoints:**
**Stateless authentication**
In stateless authentication, the server does not maintain session state and relies on tokens to authenticate each request.
